This folder contains 3 exploratory visualizations utilizing the provided dataset
and the tool RAWGraphs. 

Visualization 1:
Beeswarm visual showing each country on the y axis, and time on the x axis. 
The dots represent tests with the radius increasing with the amound of tests, 
and the color of the dots shows the location type. This shows the US and Russia 
as the two major parties launching nuclear tests and shows the transition from 
atmostpheric tests to underground, and finally a steady and smaller amount of lab 
tests in the late ninties. 

Visualization 2:
Sankey diagram showing each country and how the total quantity of tests flows 
into either of the 3 location types. This visual allows me to easily compare what 
proportion of all tests are atmospheric, underground, and lab, and to see what 
each country's portion of those totals are. This visual doesn't take time into 
account as one of the variables.

Visualization 3: 
A steamgraph that shows how the location type (shown in color) changed over time, 
showing quantity of tests of those types with size of the section.This visual 
helps to show the years in which overall tests were high, and then additionally, 
what type of tests those were. I can also see when there were drop offs (1990s).
