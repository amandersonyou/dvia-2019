## Process

I have made 3 sketches of how to map time using components learned from the 
Bertin Retinal Variables excercise.

### Concept 1: Synesthete's Clock
I am a person who experiences grapheme synesthesia, which essentially means I 
percieve numbers and letters to have specific colors. I decided to play with 
this association for concept 1. I am using the retinal variable of color to 
map changes of seconds, minutes and hours. The time is represented in 6 colored 
bars, from left to right like a typical digital display, the first two bars are 
the hour, the middle two bars are the minutes, and the right most two bars are 
the seconds. The clock is in miliary time, so there is no need to otherwise 
differentiate between AM and PM. The "key" is the colors I percieve for each 
number (0-9). This means that the clock is like a secret code, and useless to 
anyone else. 
Note: concept changed after getting into the coding and finding out what I could
accomplish at this stage.



### Concept 2: Cat Eye Clock
As a cat lover, I have stared lovingly into cat eyes enough to know their pupils 
change size dramatically throughout the day; most often when calm, playful, or 
when "hunting". For this clock, my intent is to use the retinal variable of size 
to differentiate time. The cat eye pupil is largest at midnight, and gradially 
becomes smaller by noon, and grows gradually larger again in the afternoon to 
be its fullest again by midnight. This clock is meant to give you a small hint 
at the time, but not to give you much useful detail. It's aloof, like a real cat.


### Concept 3: Rube Goldberg Clock
This clock uses position, size and also literal quantity to map time. The idea 
is to have three stacked bars that are all slightly angled to give an illusion 
of one tipping onto another like a Rube Goldberg machine. The top bar shows 
seconds, middle is minutes, and the bottom one is hours. Each second, a small 
circle is added to the bar on the right edge, when 59 seconds have passes, a 
medium size circle appears to "drop" onto the middle bar representing a minute. 
Eventually, when 59 minutes have passed, a larger circle "drops" onto the hour 
bar. You would be able to tell the time by counting the hour circles (up to 24),
the minute circles, and the second circles. 
Note: concept changed after getting into the coding and finding out what I could
accomplish at this stage.
