# Final Project

![Plaid](Plaid.png "Plaid Concept")

For this final clock, I evolved one of my first time clocks to include date 
structure as well. When including 6 time variables, I wanted to keep it minimal,
while still having the recognizable structure of plaid. The retinal variables I 
utilized were color, position, and size. I grouped the date times in green, the 
clock times in blues, and used lightness and darkness within the color to 
distingush between the times within each group with the longer times being darker.
For position, the lines progress either from top to bottom or from left to right
with time and at the rate of each time variable. And finally size is determined 
by how "many" of that time there is in it's grouping -- example, 24 hours, 12 months
